kdewin-tools provides supplementary tools which are required for compiling 
KDE applications on Windows. 

The tools (png2ico, svg2ico) are used by the cmake buildsystem to support 
windows application icons and to add specific vista manifests to applications
(mt for mingw and vs2005). 

The tool png2multipng is used to create multiple application icons from a
single svg(z) file.4
